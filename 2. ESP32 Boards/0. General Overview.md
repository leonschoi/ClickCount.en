# 0. General Overview

The ClickCounter System consists of:

- ClickCounter Website
- ESP32 Boards
- ClickCounter service (daemon process)
- ClickTally service (daemon process)

1. ClickCounter Website
  
   - `http://"Hostname"` (or `http://localhost` on the installed computer) will access the ClickCounter website.
   - It shows all the current and archived reports and logs  as hyperlinks.
   - Clicking on the report name will open a new tab to show the content.

2. ESP32 Boards

   - ESP32 boards with attached switch buttons are connected to the local network via Wi-Fi, and sends TCP/IP messages to ClickCounter service on each click of the button.

3. ClickCounter Service

   - A Windows computer running the ClickCounter service (daemon) receives TCP/IP messages from the ESP32 boards and saves them.

4. ClickTally Service

   - The same Windows computer runs the ClickTally service to process the saved data by ClickCounter.  It updates the report files.

This chapter explains the ESP32 Boards.

ESP32 software installation requires a USB connection from Windows to ESP32 boards via Arduino IDE, and the modification of the ESP32 code to specify the Wi-Fi login ID/password and the hostname to contact ClickCounter service.

If the wire from ESP32 is loosely connected to the switch, it will generate a fast sequence of clicks when the switch is touched and the wire loses contact. This sequence is different from actual press contact of the switch and cannot be blocked by software.  Therefore a solid contact at the connectors of the button switch and ESP32 is essential.

Input:

- click signal from the button switch

Output:

- TCP/IP signal to a host computer via Wi-Fi
