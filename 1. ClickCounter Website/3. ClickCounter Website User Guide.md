# 3. ClickCounter Website User Guide

## 1. Click Counter webpage

With `http://"Hostname"` (or `http://localhost` on the installed computer), all reports and logs are displayed on the website.

The files in the Current section are the files being updated today. When business hours are over, those files will move to the Archive section with the date added to the file name. Additionally, reports and logs of previous days are also displayed in the Archive section.

Current files are displayed with the time of last update and listed in descending chronological order so users can quickly verify update progress. The webpage is refreshed every second (can be adjusted to other intervals by modifying the HTML file) to display report update times without delay.

Each file name can be clicked to view the content. The clicked page will open in a new tab.

## 2. Report webpage

Clicking the report file name opens a new tab displaying the report page with the lastest accumulated click count.

If the page is too large, use Ctrl- to shrink the view.

## 3. Log

The log page displays process information or error messages generated by ClickCounter and ClickTally services.

When this webpage is opened or refreshed, the page automatically scrolls to the bottom to display the latest information.

## 4. ESP32 ID to Station ID Mapping

The mapping information is pulled from GoogleSheets when ClickTally service starts. This webpage shows the mapping used at the moment.

## 5. Work Days of the Week

Because ClickTally service runs continuously in the background, it needs to know when not to process ClickCount information. The _Work Days of the Week_ are specified in the file `C:\YIC\Config\DaysOfWeek.json` (see the ClickTally chapter for further explanation) and displayed on the webpage.

## 6. Work Time to Slot ID Mapping

_Work Time to Slot ID_ mapping is specified in the file `C:\YIC\Config\TimeSlot.json` (see the ClickTally chapter for further explanation).

The slot time interval is measured from the specified time to the time of the next slot. Therefore, the last period with 'None' as _slot ID_ is required to mark the end time of the last slot.

## 7. Work Calendar

Combining information from _Work Days of the Week_ and _Work Time to Slot ID Mapping_, the weekly activity schedule will be displayed.
