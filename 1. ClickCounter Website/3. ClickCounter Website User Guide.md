# 3. ClickCounter Website User Guide

## 1. Click Counter webpage

With `http://"Hostname"` (or `http://localhost` on the installed computer), all reports and logs are shown on the webpage.

The files under the Current section are the ones being updated today. When the end of the work hour is reached, those files move to the Archive section with the date added to the filename.  Also, the reports and logs of the previous days are shown under the Archive section.

The current files are shown with the last updated time, and listed in the decreasing order of time, so that the user can verify the update progress at a glance.  The webpage is freshed every second (it can be adjusted to other time intervals by modifying the HTML file) to show the report update time without delay.

Each filename can be clicked to view the content. The clicked page will open in a new tab.

## 2. Report webpage

Clicking on a report file name will open a new tab showing the report page with the lastest accumulated click count.

If the page is too big, use Ctrl- to shrink the view.

## 3. Log

The log page shows the process info or error messages generated by ClickCounter and ClickTally services.

When this webpage is opened or refreshed, the page automatically scrolls to the bottom so that the lastest info is shown.

## 4. ESP32 ID to Station ID Mapping

The mapping information is obtained from GoogleSheets when the ClickTally service starts. This webpage shows the mapping used at the moment.

## 5. Work Days of the Week

Because the ClickTally service runs continously in the background, it needs to know when to not process the ClickCount information.  The working days of the week are specified in the file `C:\YIC\Config\DaysOfWeek.json` (see the ClickTally chapter for more explanation) and displayed on the webpage.

## 6. Work Time to Slot ID Mapping

Work time to slot ID mapping is specified in the file `C:\YIC\Config\TimeSlot.json` (see the ClickTally chapter for more explanation).

The slot time interval is measured from the assigned time to the next slot's time. Therefore the final interval time with 'None' as the slot ID is required to mark the end time of the last slot.

## 7. Work Calendar

Combining the information from Work Days of the Week and Work Time to Slot ID Mapping, a calendar showing the weekly operation schedule is shown.
