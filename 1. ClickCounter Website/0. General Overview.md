# 0. General Overview

The ClickCounter System consists of:

- ClickCounter Website
- ESP32 Boards
- ClickCounter service (daemon process)
- ClickTally service (daemon process)

1. ClickCounter Website
  
   - `http://"Hostname"` (or `http://localhost` on the installed computer) will access the ClickCounter website.
   - It shows all the current and archived reports and logs  as hyperlinks.
   - Clicking on the report name will open a new tab to show the content.

2. ESP32 Boards

   - ESP32 boards with attached switch buttons are connected to the local network via Wi-Fi, and sends TCP/IP messages to ClickCounter service on each click of the button.

3. ClickCounter Service

   - A Windows computer running the ClickCounter service (daemon) receives TCP/IP messages from the ESP32 boards and saves them.

4. ClickTally Service

   - The same Windows computer runs the ClickTally service to process the saved data by ClickCounter.  It updates the report files.

This chapter explains the ClickCounter Website.

The website shows all reports generated: current and archived.

Each filename can be clicked to view the content. For the current reports and logs, the last updated time is shown.

The Windows web server needs to be activated and configured so the ClickCounter website can be set as the default website.
